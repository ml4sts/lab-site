# Funding from the Survival and Flourishing Fund

We received funding from the [SFF Fairness Track](https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2024-recommendations) to fund work 
developing a benchmark for fair data-driven decision making with LLMs. 
We will develop a benchmark for both data analytics style decision-making and training fair models on data. Then we will assess state of the art AI systems engaging in these tasks across various levels of AI agency.
